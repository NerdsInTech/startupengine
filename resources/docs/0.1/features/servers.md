## Deployment Automation

Startup Engine is built to be platform-agnostic. It can run on various open-source servers (Apache, NGINX, etc), with various open-source databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc), and containerized via Docker non-containerized.  

It can also be deployed to the cloud very easily via integration with [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment).
