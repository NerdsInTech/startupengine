## A/B Testing

Startup Engine has A/B testing functionality built in. To begin A/B testing a page, simply create a variation of the page you'd like to split-test by clicking the "add variation" button in the page editor.

## Recommendation Engine

Startup Engine can intelligently recommend content to your users based on what it knows about them from their usage history. If they've been referred from an external website, it will take that into account, too. This can be set to optimize for engagement or conversion based on the user's subscription status.

## E-mail Automation

Startup Engine can automatically engage your users via e-mail whenever new content is published, if they have subscribed to the topic at hand.
