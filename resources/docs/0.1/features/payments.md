## Subscriptions

Startup Engine allows you to offer products and services on a subscription-based billing model. 

Subscription products & services can have a **fixed price** (billed per day, week, month, or year), **tiered subscription plans** and/or **metered plans**, which charge per-action (i.e. per API call).

## One-Time Payments

You may also sell **physical and digital products** (traditional e-commerce) and **one-time services** (i.e. class bookings, consultations, etc).

## Platform Fees

Additionally, if you are developing a solution with Startup Engine for a third-party, you may charge additional **platform fees**, which is a percentage extracted from each transaction which will be transferred to a Stripe account of your choice. 

This is a great new way for web developers to add a passive revenue stream.
