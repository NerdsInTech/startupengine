## Resource Types

There are four main types of resources: 
- Pages
- Content Items
- Products
- Users

Each **Page** can have a custom, user-defined schema, or, in the absence of a custom schema, can defer to the default schema.

**Content Items** always use a predefined schema. There are two default content types which are immutable (Posts and Tags), but additional custom content types can be defnied by end users.

**Products** and **Users** always use a predefined schema.
