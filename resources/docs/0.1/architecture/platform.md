## About Platforms

<larecipe-card shadow>
    <larecipe-badge type="warning" circle class="mr-3" icon="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></larecipe-badge> <b>Concept: Platforms</b>
    <br><br>
    A platform is a business based on enabling value-creating interactions between external producers and consumers. The platform provides an open, participative infrastructure for these interactions and sets governance conditions for them. 
    <br><br>The platform’s purpose is to consummate matches among users and facilitate the exchange of goods, services, or some sort of social currency, thus enabling meaningful value exchanges between all participants.
    <br><br>Platforms all have an ecosystem with the same basic structure, comprising four types of players:
    <br><br>            
    <strong>Owners</strong> of platforms control their intellectual property and governance. 
    <br><strong>Providers</strong> serve as the platforms’ interface with users.
    <br><strong>Producers</strong> create their offerings, and <strong>consumers</strong> use those offerings.

## Multi-Sided Payments

Startup Engine makes it easy to implement custom payment policies. 

You may specify a **global platform fee** to be deducted from any transaction and paid to your Stripe account. 
For example, this is ideal for web developers who want to enter into more lucrative arrangements with their clients.

Startup Engine can also be used as a product & service **marketplace**, in which a portion the proceeds from the transactions between **buyers and sellers** are kept by the **platform owner** (you).
 
This is all powered under-the-hood by [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect).
